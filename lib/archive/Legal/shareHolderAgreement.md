2. ORGANISATION OF THE COMPANY
2.0 The affairs of the Company will be managed by a board of three (3) directors unless changed by a unanimous Directors' Resolution. The present directors of the Company are [DIRECTORS’ NAMES]. It is agreed that [SHAREHOLDERS’ NAMES] shall each be entitled to elect one director to the board of directors of the Company so long as each is a Shareholder. Two (2) directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business at any meeting of the board of directors. At all meetings of the board of directors, every motion to be carried must receive a majority of the votes cast, subject to the provisions of subparagraphs 2.4 and 2.5. Unless otherwise agreed, board meetings will be held at the head office of the Company.
2.1 In the event that a nominee to the Board of one of the Shareholders shall fail to vote and act as a director to carry out the provisions of this agreement, then the shareholders agree to exercise their right as shareholders of the Company and in accordance with the Articles of the Company to remove such nominee from the Board and to elect in the place or stead thereof such individual who will use his/her best efforts to carry out the provisions of this agreement but only in the event that the Shareholder whose nominee has been removed fails to appoint a successor within a period of fourteen days from the date such nominee has been removed.
(the above gives the shareholders some clout in the event that a useless nominee is appointed. Initially, this shouldn't be a problem insofar as the shareholders are also acting as directors.)
2.2 The election, appointment and determination of officers and the auditors and advisors of the Company, the defining of their duties and functions and the salaries and remuneration to be paid to them will be a function of the board of directors. Until changed by the board of directors, the Officers of the Company and their annual salaries shall be:
Office Held: Name Annual Salary:
Director: [NAME] [SALARY]
Secretary: [NAME] [SALARY]
All direct out-of-pocket expenses will be reimbursed provided these fall within guidelines set out by the Board of Directors from time to time. Until otherwise agreed, each officer of the Company will commit to spending his/her full time on the affairs of the Company.
Until changed by the board of directors, the auditors and advisors of the Company shall be:
Auditor:
Legal Advisors:
2.3 There shall be kept, in such bank or banks (including trust companies) as may be determined by the board of directors, bank accounts of the Company in which shall be deposited all monies received by the Company in the course of carrying on business from time to time. All payments on account of the Company shall be made by cheques drawn on the bank account and all cheques, drafts or other instruments drawn and made for the purposes of the business of the Company shall be executed by such directors, officers or employees as may from time to time be authorised so to do by the board of directors.
2.4 All parties who are employees of or consultants to the Company, shall use their best efforts to promote and maintain the interests of the Company.
2.5 Subject to paragraph 2.6, all decisions relating to the management and control of the business of the Company shall be determined by the board of directors of the Company, provided always that the following matters shall be determined by a Special Directors' Resolution:

(b) any lease commitments greater than £xxxx;
(c) the acquisition of any business interests by the Company;
(d) the elections of officers of the Company;
(e) the payment of any cash dividends or stock dividends to Shareholders of the Company;

(j) the liquidation or winding up of the Company;
(k) the approval of any contracts or transactions outside the normal course of business;
(l) the execution of any contract involving a consideration greater than £xxxx within the normal course of business;
(m) the lending of money by the Company;
(n) the guarantee by the Company of the debts or obligations of any other person, firm or body corporate;

(b) the salaries and bonuses of officers and directors of the Company;
(c) the issue, redemption or purchase of any Shares; and
(d) changes in the number of directors of the Company
2.7 The Shareholders may pledge any of their Shares as security for any borrowings by them provided the pledgee executes an agreement, in writing, providing that the pledgee shall be subject to all of the terms of this Agreement.
2.8 The board of directors shall meet at least four times during each fiscal year of the Company. Any director can call a meeting provided 10 days notice is given. Notice may be waived. During the first year from the date of this agreement, the board of directors shall meet on a monthly basis. Directors may elect to attend a board meeting by telephone conference call.
2.9 Each Shareholder shall, for so long as s/he is the owner of shares of the Company devote such of his/her business, time and energy as may be reasonably required to carry on the business of the Company and the Shareholder shall use his/her best efforts, skill and abilities to promote the interests of the Company. Each Shareholder agrees that he/she will not engage, without the consent of the other Shareholders, in a business which is directly competitive to that of the Company.
2.10 The Company agrees to provide to the Shareholders monthly income statements within a reasonable time, but no greater than 30 days, after the end of each month commencing from the date hereof.
2.10 The Parties agree that a Company Business Plan will be prepared and maintained on an ongoing basis with at least annual reviews and updates. This Business Plan will define the operational details of the Company and will include, but not be limited to, items such as: budgets, forecasts, capital expenditures, salaries and wages, hours of operation, market information (products, services, pricing, discounts, etc). The Plan will serve the purpose of giving management direction as to the day-to-day operation of the Company.
3. RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL
3.0 If any of the Shareholders wishes to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any or all of his/her Shares (such party being called the "Seller"), the other Shareholders (the Offerees") shall have a prior right to buy such Shares (the "Offered Shares") and the following shall apply (note that in the event that a Shareholder wishes to buy shares from other Shareholders, that Shareholder may solicit offers from potential Sellers in accordance herewith):
3.1 The Seller shall give to the Offerees notice in writing of his/her desire or intention to sell all or any of his/her Shares to them. Such notice shall be given either by facsimile transmission or registered letter addressed to the Offerees at the addresses set opposite their names in Schedule 3.1 hereto annexed (or at such other address or addresses as may be notified from time to time in writing by each Shareholder to the others) or by serving such notice upon the Offerees personally, and, if mailed as aforesaid, such notice shall be deemed to have been given to the Offerees on the second business day following the mailing thereof. This notice (the "Selling Notice") shall set out:
(i) the number of Shares beneficially owned by the Seller;
(ii) the number and class of Shares which make up the Offered Shares, the price and the
terms and conditions of the sale of the Offered Shares.
3.2 Each Offeree may, within a period of sixty days next following the date when the Selling Notice shall be deemed to have been given, give written notice either by facsimile transmission or by registered letter, addressed to the Seller at the address set opposite his/her name on Schedule 3.1 hereto annexed (or such other address as may be prescribed in the Selling Notice) or by serving the notice personally on the Seller. This notice (the "Buying Notice") shall state either that such Offeree is willing to purchase the Offered Shares, or that s/he is not willing to purchase the Offered Shares. If an Offeree fails to give the Buying Notice s/he will be deemed to have refused to purchase the Offered Shares.
3.3 After receipt by the Seller of each Buying Notice, or after the expiry of sixty days from the date of the Selling Notice, whichever is earlier, the Seller shall be bound to sell all the Offered Shares to the Offerees who have indicated in the Buying Notice that they wish to purchase the Offered Shares (the "Buyers") at such price and on such terms as contained in the Selling Notice.
3.4 If more than one Offeree has given a Buying Notice to the Seller indicating his/her willingness to purchase the Offered Shares, then, the Buyers shall purchase all the Shares comprising the Offered Shares in such proportions as they may agree upon, or, in the absence of agreement, in the Common Share Ratios of each Buyer, computed without reference to the Seller's Shares.
3.5 If the Offerees by reason of the provisions hereinbefore contained, do not purchase the Offered Shares then the Seller shall be at liberty to sell the Offered Shares to an Outsider but only at a price equal to or in excess of the price contained in the Selling Notice and on the same terms as disclosed in the Selling Notice. If, within the earlier of one hundred and twenty days of the date of the Selling Notice or sixty days of the date or receipt of the last Buying Notice by the Seller indicating the refusal of the Offerees to purchase the Offered Shares, the Seller has not received an unconditional offer to purchase the Shares from an Outsider and has not completed the sale of the Offered Shares to the Outsider within sixty days of the date of receipt of the unconditional offer, then the rights of the Offerees shall revive in respect of the
Offered Shares and if the Seller shall thereafter desire to sell any of his/her Shares s/he shall again give notice pursuant to paragraph 3.1 and so on from time to time. The Seller shall serve a copy of the Outside Offer upon the Offerees pursuant to Paragraph 3.1 prior to selling the Offered Shares to the Outsider.
3.6 Any offer to purchase Shares from an Outsider must include the condition that the Outsider agrees to become a party to this agreement pursuant to the purchase of the Shares.
4. TAG ALONG PROVISIONS
4.0 In the event that each member of a group of Shareholders, which group holds a majority of the common shares, serves a Selling Notice in connection with the same Outside Offer and if after the Outside Offer is served upon the Offerees in accordance with paragraph 3.5, one or more of the Offerees decide that s/he or they wish to sell their Shares to the Outsider on the same terms and conditions as contained in the Outside Offer, then the group shall not be entitled to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the Offered Shares unless the Outsider purchases at the same time and on the same terms and conditions all of the Shares of the Offerees who so desire to sell their Shares.

4.1 In the event that any Shareholder serves a Selling Notice in accordance with paragraph 3.5 in connection with an Outside Offer which provides for a sale, the completion of which would result in the ownership by the Outsider of a majority of the common shares, and should one or more of the Offerees decide that s/he or they wish to sell their Shares to the Outsider on the same terms and conditions as contained in the Outside Offer, then the Shareholder serving the Selling Notice shall not be entitled to sell, transfer of otherwise dispose of the Offered Shares unless the Outsider purchases at the same time and on the same terms and conditions all of the Shares of the Offerees who so desire to sell their Shares.
4.2 In the event that some of the Shareholders accept an offer from an Outsider to purchase a minimum of 75% of the common shares, then all of the Shareholders (including any Shareholder who did not accept the Outsider's offer to purchase) shall be required to sell all of their common shares to the Outsider on the same terms and conditions, if the Outsider desires to purchase such Shares, and only if the purchase price is at least equal to the Valuation Schedule attached as Schedule A to this agreement.
4.3 For the purpose of Article 4, separate offers addressed to each member of a group of Shareholders or any combination of them by the same Outsider or by separate Outsiders or any combination of Outsiders acting in concert shall be considered a single Outside Offer.
5. PRE-EMPTIVE RIGHTS
5.0 Notwithstanding the articles of incorporation of the Company, the following shall apply to the allotment and issuance by the Company of any Shares:
5.1 If the Company proposes to issue further shares (the "Issued Shares"), the Issued Shares shall be offered to the Shareholders at a price and upon terms determined by the board of directors. The Company shall give written notice (the "Issuing Notice") to each of the Shareholders, setting forth the price at which, and terms on which the Issued Shares are being offered.
5.2 The Issuing Notice shall state the time at which a meeting (the "Meeting") of the Shareholders shall be held for the purposes of this Article 5 at the head office of the Company on a day which shall be not earlier than the 15th day following the date the Issuing Notice is given, provided that if the 15th day is a Saturday, Sunday or statutory holiday, the date for the Meeting shall be the next following business day.
5.3 Each Shareholder wishing to purchase part or all of the Issued shares may attend the Meeting either personally or by his/her representative duly appointed for such purpose. A Shareholder proposing to be represented at the Meeting shall deposit with the Secretary of the Company at or prior to the Meeting an instrument in writing, designating the representative and, if desired, an alternate representative or, alternate representatives, authorised to act on behalf of such Shareholder at the Meeting.
5.4 The Secretary of the Company shall act as Chairman of the Meeting and may prescribe such procedures for the conduct of the Meeting not inconsistent with the provisions of this Article 5 as s/he may consider appropriate for the purposes of carrying out the intent of this Article 5.
5.5 If the Shareholders represented at the Meeting accept the offer stated in the Issuing Notice, the Shareholders shall subscribe for the Issued Shares in accordance with the Issuing Notice and shall execute a written subscription in accordance therewith which shall be accepted forthwith by the Company. The Shareholders shall be entitled to subscribe for and purchase the Issued Shares in such proportions as they may agree upon or, in default of such agreement, in their Common Share Ratios.
5.6 Any Issued Shares which are not subscribed for by the Shareholders in accordance with this Article 5 may be offered by the Company to a third party at the price and on the terms in the Issuing Notice, provided that no subscription shall be accepted by the Company for the sale of any such shares to a third party except with the written consent of the holders of not less than two-thirds of the common shares in the capital stock of the Company at such time outstanding.
6. OPTION TO PURCHASE ON DEATH OR OTHER DISABILITY

Schedule A will state the value of the Company (i.e. the value of 100% of the Shares of the Company) as determined by unanimous agreement of all Shareholders. In the event that the Shareholders fail to reach unanimous agreement as to valuation, the Company's auditors will make the determination and it shall be binding on all Shareholders.
6.3 The Company will maintain insurance policies on each shareholder, sufficient to provide for that Shareholder's share of the valuation as per Schedule A, and shall name as beneficiaries the other Shareholders, in accordance with the ratio of their shareholdings in the Company.
