# Hypersurface Protocol

Welcome to Hypersurface. A digital equity infrastructure for the internet age. 

Hypersurface reconfigures many of the control structures that businesses operate on using non-legal code based mechanisms.  

## Next steps

1. Consider the relative strengths of an ERC-745 claims holder as compared to an ERC-780 claims registry
2. Bool based approvals in `identity/MultiSignature.sol` and identity is done...
3. Same controls applied recursively to form organisation accounts?
4. Refactor Kali code base with support for Hypercores, particular focus on modularity and extensibility
5. Factory, storage, upgradeability 

## Addons

1. `ComplianceLimitHolder.sol` add team and restricted holder limits? i.e. Founders can't transfer more than n% per year?
2. More control logic for identities, DAO-style voting for angel networks? Are proposals directly merged with executions
3. Hypercores? Sale, corporate voting?
