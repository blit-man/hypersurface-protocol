# Hypersurface Protocol

Welcome to Hypersurface. A digital equity infrastructure for the internet age. 

Hypersurface reconfigures many of the control structures using non-legal code based mechanisms. 

Creating a new hybrid, code-based infrastructure designed for companies in the internet age. 

Hypersurface makes the issuance, management, and transfer of digital equity as easy as sending email. 

Companies made partly out of code. 

The benefits of code are that it is unambiguous, self-executing and 

The benefits of law are that it is ambiguous, holistic(?) and applicable in meatspace.

## Next steps

1. Consider the relative strengths of an ERC-745 claims holder as compared to an ERC-780 claims registry
2. HyperDAC/HyperDAO, refactor Kali code base to support for Hypercores
3. Upgradable memory/storage/factory 

Create execute, approve etc as internal tx in an identity core contract 

Then provide various wrapper control funcs i.e. identity multisig, managed, governed
